# Floating point sum

The function sum_float() adds an array F[n] of positive floating point numbers by the usual algorithm of summing to a running total. Because addition is not associative, the relative error generated due to rounding can vary depending on the order in which the numbers are added: in other words, some orders are better than others. 

Functions sums the array of positive floating points in sorted order to minimize the relative error generated due to rounding
